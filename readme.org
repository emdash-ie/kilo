#+TITLE: Readme

“Kibi” is a toy command-line editor, created by following [[https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/][the snaptoken kilo
tutorial]] and then making some tweaks (partly so I can make things more like
Haskell). The main thing I’m having fun playing around with is using macros to
make generic datastructures and functions (e.g. linked lists and functions like
~zipWith~).

* Repository structure

This project is written as a literate program using org-mode. The org source code is in [[file:source][source]], and when tangled it produces C code in [[file:tangled][tangled]], which can then be compiled with make.

[[file:source/kibi.org][kibi.org]] is the main file in the program.
