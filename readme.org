#+TITLE: Readme

“Kibi” is a toy command-line editor, created by following [[https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/][the snaptoken kilo tutorial]] and then making some tweaks (partly so I can make things more like Haskell). The main thing I’m having fun playing around with is using macros to make generic datastructures and functions (e.g. linked lists and functions like ~zipWith~).

* Repository structure

The C source code is in [[file:source][source]], which can be compiled with make. [[file:source/kibi.c][kibi.c]] is the main file in the program.
