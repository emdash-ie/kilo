#+TITLE: String

A string type that includes its length.

#+include: "../../source/string.h" :lines "3-7" src c

Can create it from regular strings by calculating the length on creation:

#+include: "../../source/string.h" :lines "8-9" src c

#+include: "../../source/string.c" :lines "3-" src c

Need ~<stddef.h>~ in the header for ~size_t~.

#+include: "../../source/string.h" :lines "1-2" src c

Need ~<string.h>~ in the body for ~strlen~.

#+include: "../../source/string.c" :lines "2-3" src c
