* The Main Loop

In the main loop, the editor runs a single process, which runs in a loop, alternately refreshing the screen and processing user input, blocking until the input is available.

#+include: "../../source/kibi.c" :lines "1090-1094" src c

* main

The main function [[*Raw Mode][puts the terminal into raw mode]], reads the command line arguments, sets up the editor, and then enters the main loop.

#+include: "../../source/kibi.c" :lines "1065-" src c

* Raw Mode

The program puts the terminal into raw mode to get more control of the screen, where normally the terminal would just accumulate everything.

I donâ€™t really know much about the details. The code gets the current terminal settings, stores them, then makes a modified copy to set. It also arranges for ~disableRawMode~ to be called when the program exits.
