Want to be able to say:
- draw this buffer on this pane
- draw this pane on this screen

Different panes should be able to:
- navigate to different places in the buffer
- have different sizes
- be positioned by their parent (probably a separate Window object?)

I like the idea of drawing on a pane being a function that's basically
draw :: Buffer -> Pane -> [Line], where the lines are what should be drawn.
I'm a little worried about doing a lot of work between the buffer and the
screen for no reason, and slowing the whole thing down.

Questions to ask:
- What's the ideal format/structure for the parent to receive in order to
  combine panes onto the screen?
  - Will be plopping it all into an append buffer, so just need to be able to
    memcpy it into place.
  - Readonly view (keeping wrapping, rendering on the buffer side) (?)
  -> So probably a linked list of pointers to characters in original lines
     to start at, and a number of characters to read. Pane should make sure
     this is a safe number of characters to read â€“ parent will append blanks
     as needed.
  => Buffer -> Pane -> [(String, Width)]
- What's the ideal format/structure for a pane to get from a buffer?
  - Linked list of lines, starting at (bufferCursor - paneCursor)
  -> Buffers need a function: lines :: RelativeIndex -> LinkedList[Line]
